# Interactive Rating Component

An interactive UI component built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** that demonstrates clean state management, DOM manipulation, and conditional rendering without relying on external frameworks.

---

## Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world feedback interaction where users select a rating from 1 to 5 and receive an immediate visual confirmation. The UI transitions from a rating state to a thank-you state using controlled class toggling and dynamic content updates.

The implementation focuses on clarity, maintainability, and separation of concerns between structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

---

## Key Features

* Interactive rating selection with active state handling
* Centralized state management using a single source of truth variable
* Conditional UI rendering via CSS class toggling
* Defensive programming (submit validation if no rating selected)
* Clean component-based structure using semantic HTML
* Fully responsive layout

---

## Technical Highlights

* Efficient DOM querying (elements cached once)
* Event-driven architecture
* Avoidance of unnecessary reflows and redundant selectors
* Use of `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for security and performance
* CSS-driven UI transitions rather than inline styling in JavaScript

---

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## Learning Objectives

This project reinforces:

* Understanding of DOM traversal and manipulation
* Managing UI state without frameworks
* Writing predictable and maintainable event-driven code
* Structuring small components in a scalable way
